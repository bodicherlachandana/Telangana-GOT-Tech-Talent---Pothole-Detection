JNTU, Hyderabad - Blackbucks has launched a hackathon on Traffic Management, seamless transportation models, smart traffic management and road safety.
Theme choosed is about detecting the potholes.
Potholes have turned out to be a major cause of road accidents and a number of deaths have been reported recently after people lost control of their vehicles while navigating them. 
Road potholes are not just an inconvenience, they are also a significant threat to vehicle conditions and traffic safety.
The traditional practices of inspecting road potholes require human intervention which has proven to be inefficient.
For these reasons, researchers have been dedicated to developing techniques for the process of road condition assessment systems.
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have proven their abilities for many object detection tasks.  

Objectives:
1. cost-effective vision-based technique
2. accurate and effiecient model compared to manual inspection
3. can be integrated with self-driving vehicles

To detect the potholes accurately and faster, we used YOLOv7.
